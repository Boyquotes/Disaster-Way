<a href="https://godotengine.org/"><img width="100" alt="Godot Engine" src="https://godotengine.org/assets/press/logo_small_color_dark.svg"></a>

This game was build using the Godot Engine 3.5.1
You can download this version using [this link](https://downloads.tuxfamily.org/godotengine/3.5.1/).





## Getting Started



### Installation

You should use a pre-built binaty, is the easier way to install the game and play it inmediatly, you can download the bin failes from [this link](https://github.com/IsmaCortGtz/Disaster-Way/releases).

The game are compiled for this plattaforms:
  * Windows
  * Linux
  * Android (70%)

***DISCLAIMER:*** The game only works with a gamepad or a keyboard, if you wanna play it in android, you will need one of them to do it.



### Custom Stage Format

The game has a feature to add your own stages changing some variables of the Game room using a specific format, for example, this is the code for the common `Last Standing`:

```sh
1-800-4500-1500-1800-0.5-3.5-60-1
```

Each var are splitted with the `-` character, and all for them need to be a valid number up to 0. And an adittional condition, the first and the last numbers need to be an integer. This are the menaings for the vars:

1. `gameModeType`: _`int`_. The type gamemode to play, we have two options here:
    - `1`: Last Standing
    - `2`: Time Trial
2. `playersMaxSpeed`: The max speed the players can get.
3. `playerAcel`: The acceleration the players will have.
4. `bulletsVelRange.x`: The min velocity of the bullets.
5. `bulletsVelRange.y`: The max velocity of the bullets.
6. `bulletsControllCooldown.x`: The min of time before other bullet will be shotted in the same spot.
7. `bulletsControllCooldown.y`: The max of time before other bullet will be shotted in the same spot.
8. `gameTimeTrialDuration`: The duration of the game if the game mode type is Time Trial. (Even if you are using Last Standig gamemode, this number needs to be up to 0)
9. `specialTimesUses`: _`int`_. The number of times that players can use them special ability.

***DISCLAIMER:*** The game doesn't have any system to limit the max value of any var, use it by your own responsibility.



### Building

Aditionally, you can build in your machine the project for any of the [supported plattaforms](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/3.5/tutorials/export/exporting_basics.html) by Godot 3.5.1.

Remember, to export for iOS and macOS you will need a mac to compile the XCode project.

This are the instroctions to build for your own the project.

1. Clone the repo
```sh
git clone https://github.com/IsmaCortGtz/Disaster-Way.git
``` 
2. Install Godot 3.5.1 and launch it, you can do it from [this link](https://downloads.tuxfamily.org/godotengine/3.5.1/).
3. Install the [sounds of the proyect](#adding-sounds).
4. Open in Godot the proyect you clone in the step #1.
5. Install the Godot Export Templates, you can follow [this instructions](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/3.5/tutorials/export/exporting_projects.html).
6. Configure the porject for the plattaform target, you should check [this reference](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/3.5/tutorials/export/index.html).
